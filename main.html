    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the computational time an algorithm takes to execute. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, making them more practical for larger inputs.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires during execution. It is often expressed in terms of O(n), where n represents the input size.</p>
